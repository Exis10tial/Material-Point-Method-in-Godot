# Material-Point-Method-in-Godot

Looking to implementing MLS version of Material Point Method in Godot Engine.

up to Version.10.1.0:

A project I wanted to work on and for that project, I ended up wanting/needed to use Material Point Method. 
This is the MLS-version of Material Point Method I'm looking to implement. 
I have been using Godot 4 , v4.2.stable.official [46dc27791] being the latest

some progress clips.

The flicker of the polygon is cause of how the polygon is drawn.
not testing a model. just checking movement of the polygon.

The First clip is when the walls has a 'coefficient of restitution' is equal to 1

The Second clip is when the walls has a 'coefficient of restitution' is equal to .62
