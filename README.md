# Material-Point-Method-in-Godot

Looking to implementing MLS version of Material Point Method in Godot Engine.

A project I wanted to work on and for that project, I ended up wanting/needed to use Material Point Method. 
This is the MLS-version of Material Point Method I'm looking to implement. 
I have been using Godot 4 alphas versions , v4.0.alpha13.official [59dcddc45] being the latest


V.1.0.0
--- contains 4 constitutive models in Neohookean,Fixed-Corotated,Water,Drucker_Prager
