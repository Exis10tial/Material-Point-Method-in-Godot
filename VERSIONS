Sort of a version update of changes I continue to make.

V.1.0.0:
|
 ---- contains 4 constitutive models: Neohookean,Fixed_Corotated(snow),water,Drucker_Prager(sand)
      contains collision detection only for the outline of the windows not between other particles.
      used nodes for the particles
      matrix math used [[]] for 2D-arrays.
      
      at the time used Godot v4.0.alpha13.official [59dcddc45]
      
V.2.0.0:
|
 ---- Added collision detection between particles.
      math corrections/changes.
      used various godot v4.0 betas
V.3.0.0:
|
 ---- Stopped using nodes for the particles and went to something else...
      math corrections/changes.
      rearranged the procedure of the simulation ( mainly the grip/particle resets )
      used various godot v4.0 betas
V.4.0.0:
|
 ---- Introduce a different way of collision detection between the particles.
      math corrections/changes.
      used various godot v4.0 betas
V.5.0.0:
|
 ---- matrix math used went to [] 1D arrays
      math corrections/changes.
      rearranged how the simulation was setup in the nodes.
      broke the process from 1 large function of the simulation into various smaller functions
      thought/started to moving into C# instead of GDScript (also have a python-in-godot version)
          C# went nowhere cause.
          python-in-godot version did work.
      used various godot v4.0 betas

V.5.5.0:(failed/incomplete)
|
 ---- tried to used the physics engine manually thru PhysicsServer2D for the particles
      
V.6.0.0:
|
 ---- Reestablished from the failed/incomplete try of PhysicsServer2D
      A lot of math corrections/changes probably need more.
      v4.0.beta10.official [d0398f62f]

V.6.0.2:
|
---- adjusted the particles mass property application.
     an option in handling boundary conditions of the particles (for/during collision detection)
     v4.0.beta11.official [91713ced8]

V.6.4.0:
|
---- change how weight interpolation interaction between particles, altered how the grid(has always confused me) operates.
     put in as an option; plain,original,normal: Material Point Method
     corrected how particles is created/arranged
     more math corrections.
     v4.0.rc2.official [d2699dc7a]

V.7.0.0:
|
---- altered how the particle is represented and displayed. (was a Rect2 and drawn as a Rect2, now is a Transform2d and drawn as a Image).
     v4.0.stable.official [92bee43ad]
     
V.7.0.2:
|
---- math corrections ( how "forces" is calculated ) 

V.7.0.3:
|
---- math corrections ( how the particle interact with the wall (window outline) ) 

V.7.1.0:
|
---- math corrections ( parts of weight interpolation was incorrect.)
     reassert the MLS verison of mpm. ( the original mpm is still there just commented out ; can go back and forth between original and MLS just comment or uncomment the portions).
     v4.0.stable.official [92bee43ad]
     
 V.7.2.0:
|
---- math corrections (weight interpolation),(math between particle/wall collisions), (constitutive models math), (the math of MPM and MLS MPM)
     v4.0.1.stable.official [cacf49999]

V.8.0.0:
|
---- proper "background eulerian" grid is implemented. I didn't quite understand the grid, up until now the weight-interpolation 
     was done/handled between each particle relation to every other particle. Now weight-interpolation is done between the grid and particle.
     math corrections ( weight interpolation),(math of MLS program)
     v4.0.1.stable.official [cacf49999]

V.8.3.0:
|
---- collision between the particles and walls(window outline) was reinserted.
     particles now also can rotate.
     v4.0.1.stable.official [cacf49999]

V.8.3.5:
|
---- corrections to how the particles collided with the wall(window outline)
     v4.0.1.stable.official [cacf49999]

V.8.3.7:
|
---- the constitutive models was reinserted. All still need more testing, 
     but can't properly test: Fixed_Corotated(snow),water,Drucker_Prager(sand) - cause unable the particle count is far too low (next problem to solve)
     Neohookean - should work, but still require more testing.
     v4.0.1.stable.official [cacf49999]


V.8.4.0:
|
---- Increased the allowable number of different substances ( from 1 to whatever),
     (already had the ability for substances to be represented/show by any number of particles from 1 to whatever)
